Before you start looking at the data, discuss what predictions you have and why?
 - Longer RTs and more errors when there is incongruency between circle size and pitch (i.e. larger circles are congruent with higher pitched noises, and vice versa).


```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse)

# Try to make a plot of the mean reaction times per congruency. You might want to remove incorrect responses first. You can also make a graph of accuracy rate.


# Interpret the findings. Do they match your predictions? Why? Why not?
```
