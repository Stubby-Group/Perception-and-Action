Before you start looking at the data, discuss what predictions you have and why?
 - Longer RTs and more errors when there is incongruency between circle size and pitch (i.e. larger circles are congruent with higher pitched noises, and vice versa).


```{r}
# Try to make a plot of the mean reaction times per congruency. You might want to remove incorrect responses first. You can also make a graph of accuracy rate.

# Interpret the findings. Do they match your predictions? Why? Why not?
```

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, plyr)
# load vision data
filenames_list <- list.files(path = "crossmodal data", pattern = "*vision*", full.names = TRUE)
vision_data = ldply(filenames_list, read_csv)

# change the name of the version to vision instead of auditory
vision_data$version <- "vision"

# load audition data
filenames_list <- list.files(path = "crossmodal data", pattern = "*audition*", full.names = TRUE)
audition_data = ldply(filenames_list, read_csv)

# rbind the two types of tasks into one dataframe
df <- rbind(vision_data, audition_data)
```
